Predicting COVID-19 severity through interpretable AI analysis of plasma proteomics

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlighted the need for software tools which could facilitate patient triage in terms of potential disease severity or even death. In this article, a Machine Learning (ML)-based approach aiming to predict the severity of their condition using plasma proteomics data as input.
An overview of AI-based technical developments to support COVID-19 patient management is presented outlining the landscape of relevant technical developments. Based on this review, the use of an ensemble of ML algorithms that analyse clinical and biological data (e.g., plasma proteomics) of COVID-19 is designed and deployed to evaluate the potential use of AI for early COVID-19 patient triage. Three publicly available datasets from COVID-19 patients are used to train and validate the proposed pipeline. Three ML “tasks” are defined and several algorithms are tested through a hyperparameter tuning method to identify the highest performance models. As overfitting was identified as one of the main risks (mostly due to the size of the training/validation data sets), a variety of evaluation metrics was used.
Recall scores ranging from 0.6 to 0.74 and F1-score from 0.62 to 0.75 were achieved. The best performance is observed via MLP and SVM algorithms. Additionally, input data (proteomics and clinical data) were ranked based on corresponding SHAP values and consequently evaluated for their prognostic capacity and their immuno-biological credence. This “interpretable” approach revealed that our ML models could discern critical COVID-19 cases predominantly based on patient age and plasma proteins pertaining to B cell dysfunction, hyper-activation of inflammatory pathways like Toll-like receptors and hypo-activation of developmental and immune pathways like SCF/c-Kit signaling.
Regarding limitations of the presented ML pipeline, the datasets used in this study contain less than 1000 observations and a significant number of input features (167), hence constituting a high-dimensionality low-sample (HDLS) dataset, sensitive to overfitting. A significant advantage of the proposed pipeline is that it combined biological data (plasma proteomics) with clinical-demographic data, thus enabling patient triage in a timely fashion if used on already trained models. However, bigger datasets and further systematic validation is needed to confirm the potential clinical value of this approach.
